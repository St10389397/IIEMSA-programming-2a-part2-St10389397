Changes made from part 1
The Recipe Manager application has been improved based on feedback, and now includes two important reset options. The first option is the "Reset Recipe Scale," which allows users to reset the ingredient quantities of an individual recipe back to their original measurements, reversing any changes made to the scaling. This is beneficial for users who want to experiment with different serving sizes but need a simple way to go back to the default settings.
The second option is the "Reset All Recipes," which has been newly added. This comprehensive reset function returns all recipes in the application to their original states, reversing any modifications, scaling adjustments, or custom changes made. This ensures that users can swiftly restore their entire recipe collection to its default configuration, providing a clean slate for new adjustments or planning.
